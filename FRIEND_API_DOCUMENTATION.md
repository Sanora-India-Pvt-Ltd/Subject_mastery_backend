## Overview

The Friend API provides endpoints for managing friendships, friend requests, and discovering new friends. All endpoints require authentication and support blocking functionality to prevent interactions with blocked users.

### Key Features:
- **Friend Requests**: Send, accept, reject, and cancel friend requests
- **Friend Management**: List friends, unfriend users
- **Friend Suggestions**: Get personalized friend suggestions based on mutual friends
- **Blocking Support**: Automatically excludes blocked users from all operations (checks both `blockedUsers` and `social.blockedUsers`)
- **Bidirectional Friendship**: When a friend request is accepted, both users are added to each other's friend list
- **Backward Compatibility**: Supports both nested profile structure (`profile.name`, `profile.bio`, etc.) and legacy flat fields (`name`, `bio`, etc.)

### Friend Request Status:
- `pending`: Request has been sent but not yet accepted/rejected
- `accepted`: Request has been accepted, users are now friends
- `rejected`: Request has been rejected

---

## Authentication

All friend API endpoints require authentication. Include the access token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

**Note:** The access token is obtained from the authentication endpoints. See [AUTH_API_DOCUMENTATION.md](./AUTH_API_DOCUMENTATION.md) for details.

## Friend Request Management

### 1. Send Friend Request

**Method:** `POST`  
**URL:** `/api/friend/send/:receiverId`  
**Authentication:** Required

**Description:**  
Send a friend request to another user. The request will be in `pending` status until the receiver accepts or rejects it.

**URL Parameters:**
- `receiverId` (string, required): The MongoDB ObjectId of the user to send the friend request to

**Request Example:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/friend/send/507f1f77bcf86cd799439011 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

**Success Response (201 Created):**

  "data": {
    "friends": [
      {
        "_id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
        "name": "Jane Smith",
        "profileImage": "https://example.com/profile2.jpg",

| 404 | User not found | The authenticated user does not exist |
| 500 | Failed to retrieve friends | Internal server error |

**Notes:**
- Blocked users are automatically filtered out from the friends list (checks both `blockedUsers` and `social.blockedUsers`)
- The response includes essential friend information (ID, name, profile image, bio)
- The response format uses simplified fields (`name`, `profileImage`, `bio`) extracted from the nested profile structure or legacy flat fields for backward compatibility
- The actual database stores user data in a nested structure: `profile.name.first`, `profile.name.last`, `profile.name.full`, `profile.profileImage`, `profile.bio`, etc.
- Name extraction priority: `profile.name.full` → `profile.name.first + profile.name.last` → `profile.name.first` → `profile.name.last` → `name` → `firstName + lastName`

          "bio": "Photographer"
        },
        "mutualFriends": 0,
        "mutualFriendsList": []
      }
    ],
    "count": 1
  }
}
```

**Note:** When user has no friends, the response uses `mutualFriends` (number) and `mutualFriendsList` (array). When user has friends, it uses `mutualFriendsCount` (number) and `mutualFriends` (array).

**Error Responses:**

| Status Code | Error Message | Description |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| 404 | User not found | The authenticated user does not exist |
| 500 | Failed to retrieve friend suggestions | Internal server error |

**Notes:**
- Suggestions are based on friends of friends (mutual connections)
- Users with more mutual friends appear first
- Automatically excludes:
  - Current user
  - Existing friends
  - Blocked users (checks both `blockedUsers` and `social.blockedUsers` in both directions)
  - Users with pending friend requests
- If user has no friends, returns random users instead (with `mutualFriends: 0` and `mutualFriendsList: []`)
- Shows up to 3 mutual friends per suggestion
- User data is returned in simplified format: `_id`, `name`, `profileImage`, `bio` (extracted from nested profile structure or legacy flat fields for backward compatibility)
- Mutual friends are returned in simplified format: `_id`, `name`, `profileImage`

**Algorithm:**
1. Get all friends of the current user
2. For each friend, get their friends (friends of friends)
3. Count mutual friends for each potential suggestion
4. Sort by mutual friend count (descending)
5. Filter out excluded users (blocked, pending requests, etc.)
6. Return top N suggestions

## Data Models

### FriendRequest Model

```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,                    // Unique request ID
  sender: ObjectId,                 // Reference to User (sender)
  receiver: ObjectId,               // Reference to User (receiver)
  status: String,                   // 'pending' | 'accepted' | 'rejected'
  createdAt: Date,                  // Request creation timestamp
  updatedAt: Date                   // Last update timestamp
}
```

### User Model (Friends Array)

```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,                    // User ID
  friends: [ObjectId],              // Array of friend User IDs
  // ... other user fields
}
```

### Friend List Item

```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,                    // Friend's user ID
  name: String,                     // Friend's full name
  profileImage: String,             // Friend's profile image URL
  bio: String                       // Friend's bio/description
}
```

### Friend Suggestion Item

**When user has friends (mutual friends based):**
```javascript
{
  user: {
    _id: ObjectId,                    // Suggested user's ID
    name: String,                     // Full name (extracted from profile or legacy fields)
    profileImage: String,             // Profile image URL
    bio: String                       // User bio
  },
  mutualFriendsCount: Number,        // Number of mutual friends
  mutualFriends: [                  // Array of mutual friend objects (max 3)
    {
      _id: ObjectId,                 // Mutual friend's ID
      name: String,                   // Full name
      profileImage: String            // Profile image URL
    }
  ]
}
```

**When user has no friends (random users):**
```javascript
{
  user: {
    _id: ObjectId,                    // Suggested user's ID
    name: String,                     // Full name
    profileImage: String,             // Profile image URL
    bio: String                       // User bio
  },
  mutualFriends: 0,                   // Always 0 for random suggestions (number)
  mutualFriendsList: []              // Always empty for random suggestions (array)
}
```

**Important:** The field names differ based on whether the user has friends:
- **No friends**: Uses `mutualFriends` (number) and `mutualFriendsList` (array)
- **Has friends**: Uses `mutualFriendsCount` (number) and `mutualFriends` (array)

### User Profile Structure (Actual Database Format)

```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,                    // User ID
  profile: {
    name: {
      first: String,                // e.g., "Anushka"
      last: String,                 // e.g., "Kotiyal"
      full: String                  // e.g., "Anushka Kotiyal"
    },
    email: String,                  // e.g., "anushkakotiyal12@gmail.com"
    gender: String,                 // e.g., "Other", "Male", "Female"
    profileImage: String,           // Cloudinary URL
    pronouns: String,               // e.g., "they/them"
    bio: String,                    // User bio
    coverPhoto: String              // Cloudinary URL
  },
  location: {
    currentCity: String,
    hometown: String
  },
  friends: [ObjectId],              // Array of friend User IDs
  // ... other user fields
}
```

## Error Handling

All endpoints follow a consistent error response format:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error message describing what went wrong",
  "error": "Detailed error message (only in development mode)"
}
```

### Common HTTP Status Codes

| Status Code | Meaning | Common Scenarios |
|------------|---------|------------------|
| 200 | OK | Successful GET, POST, DELETE operations |
| 201 | Created | Successfully created a new resource |
| 400 | Bad Request | Invalid parameters, validation errors |
| 403 | Forbidden | Blocked users, unauthorized actions |
| 404 | Not Found | User or resource not found |
| 500 | Internal Server Error | Server-side errors |

### Error Response Examples

**Invalid ID Format:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Invalid receiver ID"
}
```

**Already Friends:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "You are already friends with this user"
}
```

**Blocked User:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "You cannot send a friend request to a blocked user"
}
```

**Not Found:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "User not found"
}
```

## Examples

### Complete Friend Request Flow

**1. Send a friend request:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/friend/send/507f1f77bcf86cd799439011 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

**2. Receiver checks received requests:**
```bash
curl -X GET https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/friend/requests/received \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer RECEIVER_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

**3. Receiver accepts the request:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/friend/accept/507f1f77bcf86cd799439012 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer RECEIVER_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

**4. Both users can now see each other in their friend list:**
```bash
curl -X GET https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/friend/list \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

### JavaScript Example (Fetch API)

```javascript
// Send friend request
async function sendFriendRequest(receiverId, accessToken) {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/friend/send/${receiverId}`,
    {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`
      }
    }
  );
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}

// Accept friend request
async function acceptFriendRequest(requestId, accessToken) {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/friend/accept/${requestId}`,
    {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`
      }
    }
  );
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}

// Get friend list
async function getFriendList(accessToken) {
  const response = await fetch(
    'https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/friend/list',
    {
      method: 'GET',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`
      }
    }
  );
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}

// Get friend suggestions
async function getFriendSuggestions(accessToken, limit = 10) {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/friend/suggestions?limit=${limit}`,
    {
      method: 'GET',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`
      }
    }
  );
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}

// Unfriend a user
async function unfriendUser(friendId, accessToken) {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/friend/unfriend/${friendId}`,
    {
      method: 'DELETE',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`
      }
    }
  );
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}
```

### Python Example (requests library)

```python
import requests

BASE_URL = "https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/friend"
ACCESS_TOKEN = "your_access_token_here"

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}"
}

# Send friend request
def send_friend_request(receiver_id):
    response = requests.post(
        f"{BASE_URL}/send/{receiver_id}",
        headers=headers
    )
    return response.json()

# Accept friend request
def accept_friend_request(request_id):
    response = requests.post(
        f"{BASE_URL}/accept/{request_id}",
        headers=headers
    )
    return response.json()

# Get friend list
def get_friend_list():
    response = requests.get(
        f"{BASE_URL}/list",
        headers=headers
    )
    return response.json()

# Get friend suggestions
def get_friend_suggestions(limit=10):
    response = requests.get(
        f"{BASE_URL}/suggestions",
        headers=headers,
        params={"limit": limit}
    )
    return response.json()

# Unfriend a user
def unfriend_user(friend_id):
    response = requests.delete(
        f"{BASE_URL}/unfriend/{friend_id}",
        headers=headers
    )
    return response.json()
```

## Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**: Always check the `success` field in responses before processing data
2. **Token Management**: Ensure access tokens are valid and refreshed when expired
3. **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of API rate limits when making multiple requests
4. **User Experience**: 
   - Show loading states while processing friend requests
   - Provide clear feedback for all actions (success/error)
   - Update UI immediately after accepting/rejecting requests
5. **Blocking**: Remember that blocked users are automatically excluded from all friend operations
6. **Validation**: Validate user IDs on the client side before making requests
7. **Caching**: Consider caching friend lists and suggestions for better performance

## Notes

- All timestamps are in ISO 8601 format (UTC)
- User IDs are MongoDB ObjectIds (24-character hexadecimal strings)
- Friend requests are bidirectional - when accepted, both users are added to each other's friend list
- Blocked users cannot interact with each other through the friend system
- Blocking is checked in both `blockedUsers` (root level) and `social.blockedUsers` (nested) for comprehensive blocking support
- The system supports backward compatibility with legacy flat field structure while primarily using nested profile structure
- **Database Structure**: User data is stored in a nested structure:
  ```javascript
  {
    profile: {
      name: {
        first: "Anushka",
        last: "Kotiyal",
        full: "Anushka Kotiyal"
      },
      email: "anushkakotiyal12@gmail.com",
      gender: "Other",
      profileImage: "https://res.cloudinary.com/...",
      pronouns: "",
      bio: "this is bio by Anushka",
      coverPhoto: "https://res.cloudinary.com/..."
    },
    location: {
      currentCity: "...",
      hometown: "..."
    }
  }
  ```
- API responses may return simplified formats for friend lists, but detailed responses (like friend requests) include the full nested structure
- Friend suggestions algorithm prioritizes users with more mutual friends
- Accepted friend requests are kept in the database with `accepted` status for historical tracking
- Rejected friend requests are kept in the database with `rejected` status for audit purposes
- Cancelled friend requests are permanently deleted from the database
