## Reactions System

### Overview

The reactions system allows users to express their feelings about posts and reels using 6 different reaction types:

1. **happy** 😊 - Express happiness or joy
2. **sad** 😢 - Express sadness or empathy
3. **angry** 😠 - Express anger or frustration
4. **hug** 🤗 - Express support or comfort
5. **wow** 😲 - Express surprise or amazement
6. **like** 👍 - Standard like reaction (default)

### Reaction Behavior

- **First Reaction**: When a user reacts for the first time, the reaction is added
- **Same Reaction Again**: If the user clicks the same reaction again, it removes the reaction (unlike)
- **Different Reaction**: If the user clicks a different reaction, it updates to the new reaction
- **One Reaction Per User**: Each user can only have one reaction at a time per post/reel

### Reaction Data Structure

The likes array is structured as a nested array where each sub-array contains user IDs for a specific reaction type:
```json
[
  [],  // Index 0: happy reactions (user IDs)
  [],  // Index 1: sad reactions (user IDs)
  [],  // Index 2: angry reactions (user IDs)
  [],  // Index 3: hug reactions (user IDs)
  [],  // Index 4: wow reactions (user IDs)
  []   // Index 5: like reactions (user IDs)
]
```

**Example:**
```json
{
  "likes": [
    ["user_id_1", "user_id_2"],  // 2 happy reactions
    ["user_id_3"],                // 1 sad reaction
    [],                           // 0 angry reactions
    [],                           // 0 hug reactions
    ["user_id_4"],                // 1 wow reaction
    ["user_id_5", "user_id_6", "user_id_7"]  // 3 like reactions
  ]
}
```

### Reaction Counts

You can get reaction counts by checking the length of each sub-array:
```javascript
const reactionCounts = {
  happy: likes[0] ? likes[0].length : 0,
  sad: likes[1] ? likes[1].length : 0,
  angry: likes[2] ? likes[2].length : 0,
  hug: likes[3] ? likes[3].length : 0,
  wow: likes[4] ? likes[4].length : 0,
  like: likes[5] ? likes[5].length : 0
};

// Total reactions
const totalReactions = reactionCounts.happy + reactionCounts.sad + 
                       reactionCounts.angry + reactionCounts.hug + 
                       reactionCounts.wow + reactionCounts.like;

// Check if a specific user has reacted
const userId = "user_id_1";
const userReaction = likes[0].includes(userId) ? 'happy' :
                     likes[1].includes(userId) ? 'sad' :
                     likes[2].includes(userId) ? 'angry' :
                     likes[3].includes(userId) ? 'hug' :
                     likes[4].includes(userId) ? 'wow' :
                     likes[5].includes(userId) ? 'like' : null;
```

## Comments System

### Overview

The comments system allows users to add text-based comments to posts and reels.

### Comment Data Structure

Each comment contains:
```json
{
  "_id": "comment_id_123",
  "userId": {
    "_id": "user_id_456",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "profileImage": "https://..."
  },
  "text": "This is an amazing post! Great work! 👏",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T11:30:00.000Z"
}
```

### Comment Limits

- **Character Limits**:
  - **Posts**: Maximum 1000 characters per comment
  - **Reels**: Maximum 500 characters per comment
- **Fetch Limit**: Only the **15 most recent comments** are returned in API responses. Comments are sorted by `createdAt` in descending order (newest first).
- **Total Count**: The `commentCount` field always reflects the total number of comments, even if more than 15 exist.

**Note:** When a post or reel has more than 15 comments, only the 15 most recent ones are included in the `comments` array. The `commentCount` field will show the actual total, allowing clients to display "View more comments" functionality if needed.

### Comment Permissions

- **Add Comment**: Any authenticated user can add comments
- **Delete Comment**: Only the comment owner or post/reel owner can delete comments

---

## Reporting System

### Overview

The reporting system allows users to report inappropriate posts and reels. The system automatically moderates content based on user reports, removing reported content from user feeds and permanently deleting content when multiple users report with the same reason.

### Report Reasons

Users can report content for the following reasons:

1. **problem_involving_someone_under_18** - Content involving someone under 18
2. **bullying_harassment_or_abuse** - Bullying, harassment or abuse
3. **suicide_or_self_harm** - Suicide or self-harm content
4. **violent_hateful_or_disturbing_content** - Violent, hateful or disturbing content
5. **adult_content** - Adult content
6. **scam_fraud_or_false_information** - Scam, fraud or false information
7. **intellectual_property** - Intellectual property violation
8. **political** - Political content
9. **i_dont_want_to_see_this** - User preference (don't want to see this content)

### Reporting Behavior

#### Immediate Effects
- **Feed Removal**: When a user reports a post or reel, it is immediately removed from their feed
- **One Report Per User**: Each user can only report the same content once
- **Self-Reporting Prevention**: Users cannot report their own content

#### Automatic Moderation
- **Threshold**: When 2 users report the same content with the **same reason**, the content is automatically deleted
- **Permanent Deletion**: Deleted content is permanently removed from the database
- **Media Cleanup**: All associated media (images, videos, thumbnails) is automatically deleted from Cloudinary

### Feed Filtering

Reported content is automatically filtered from user feeds:

- **Get All Posts** (`/api/posts/all`): Excludes posts reported by the authenticated user
- **Get Reels** (`/api/reels`): Excludes reels reported by the authenticated user
- **Get User Posts** (`/api/posts/user/:id`): Excludes posts reported by the viewing user
- **Get User Reels** (`/api/reels/user/:id`): Excludes reels reported by the viewing user

**Note:** Feed filtering only applies when the user is authenticated. Unauthenticated users see all content.

### Report Data Structure

Each report contains:
```json
{
  "_id": "report_id_123",
  "userId": "user_id_456",
  "contentId": "post_id_789",
  "contentType": "post",
  "reason": "bullying_harassment_or_abuse",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T12:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-01-15T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Best Practices

1. **Report Accuracy**: Users should select the most appropriate reason for reporting
2. **Multiple Reports**: The system requires 2 users with the same reason to trigger deletion
3. **Feed Privacy**: Reported content is only hidden from the reporting user's feed, not from all users
4. **Content Moderation**: The automatic deletion threshold helps prevent abuse while allowing legitimate moderation

### Example Workflow

```javascript
// Report a post
async function reportPost(postId, reason) {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/posts/${postId}/report`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ reason })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  
  if (data.data.postDeleted) {
    console.log('Post was deleted due to multiple reports');
  } else {
    console.log('Post reported successfully');
  }
  
  return data;
}

// Report a reel
async function reportReel(reelId, reason) {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/reels/${reelId}/report`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ reason })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}
```

## Data Models

### Post Model

```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  userId: ObjectId (ref: User),
  caption: String (max 2200),
  media: [{
    url: String,
    publicId: String,
    type: String (enum: ['image', 'video']),
    format: String
  }],
  likes: [[ObjectId]], // Nested array: [happy[], sad[], angry[], hug[], wow[], like[]]
  comments: [{
    userId: ObjectId (ref: User),
    text: String (max 1000),
    createdAt: Date
  }],
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Reel Model

```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  userId: ObjectId (ref: User),
  caption: String (max 2200),
  media: {
    url: String,
    publicId: String,
    thumbnailUrl: String,
    type: String (enum: ['video']),
    format: String,
    duration: Number,
    dimensions: {
      width: Number,
      height: Number
    },
    size: Number
  },
  contentType: String (enum: ['education', 'fun']),
  visibility: String (enum: ['public', 'followers', 'private']),
  views: Number,
  likes: [[ObjectId]], // Nested array: [happy[], sad[], angry[], hug[], wow[], like[]]
  comments: [{
    userId: ObjectId (ref: User),
    text: String (max 500),
    createdAt: Date
  }],
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Report Model

```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  userId: ObjectId (ref: User),
  contentId: ObjectId,
  contentType: String (enum: ['post', 'reel']),
  reason: String (enum: [
    'problem_involving_someone_under_18',
    'bullying_harassment_or_abuse',
    'suicide_or_self_harm',
    'violent_hateful_or_disturbing_content',
    'adult_content',
    'scam_fraud_or_false_information',
    'intellectual_property',
    'political',
    'i_dont_want_to_see_this'
  ]),
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

**Indexes:**
- Unique compound index on `(userId, contentId, contentType)` - prevents duplicate reports
- Compound index on `(contentId, contentType, reason)` - for efficient threshold checking

curl -X POST https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/posts/POST_ID/report \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reason": "bullying_harassment_or_abuse"}'
```

#### Report a Reel
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/reels/REEL_ID/report \

```

### JavaScript/TypeScript Example

```javascript
// React to a post
async function reactToPost(postId, reaction = 'like') {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/posts/${postId}/like`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ reaction })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}

// Add comment to a post
async function addComment(postId, text) {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/posts/${postId}/comment`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ text })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}

// Get posts with pagination
async function getPosts(page = 1, limit = 10) {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/posts/all?page=${page}&limit=${limit}`
  );
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}

// Report a post
async function reportPost(postId, reason) {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/posts/${postId}/report`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ reason })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}

// Report a reel
async function reportReel(reelId, reason) {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/reels/${reelId}/report`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ reason })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Media Upload**: Always upload media first before creating posts/reels
2. **Pagination**: Use pagination for large datasets to improve performance
3. **Error Handling**: Always check the `success` field in responses
4. **Reaction Updates**: Handle the three possible actions: "liked", "unliked", "reaction_updated"
5. **Comment Length**: Respect character limits (1000 for posts, 500 for reels)
6. **Reporting**: Select the most appropriate reason when reporting content
7. **Authentication**: Store and refresh access tokens securely
8. **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of API rate limits when making multiple requests
9. **Feed Filtering**: Remember that reported content is automatically filtered from authenticated user feeds

## Important Notes

### Likes/Reactions Structure

The likes array uses a nested array structure for efficient storage:
- `likes[0]` = happy reactions (array of user IDs)
- `likes[1]` = sad reactions (array of user IDs)
- `likes[2]` = angry reactions (array of user IDs)
- `likes[3]` = hug reactions (array of user IDs)
- `likes[4]` = wow reactions (array of user IDs)
- `likes[5]` = like reactions (array of user IDs)

This structure allows for efficient querying and counting of reactions without needing to store reaction type with each user ID.

### Video Transcoding

All videos uploaded to posts and reels are automatically transcoded to ensure compatibility:
- **Codec:** H.264 Baseline Profile 3.1
- **Pixel Format:** yuv420p
- **Faststart:** Enabled (for progressive playback)

This ensures videos play smoothly across all devices and browsers.

### Media Upload Flow

1. **Upload media first** using `/api/posts/upload-media` or `/api/reels/upload-media`
2. **Use the response data** to create the post/reel with the returned `url`, `publicId`, and other metadata
3. **Media is stored** in Cloudinary and referenced in the database

This two-step process allows for better error handling and validation before creating the post/reel.

### Content Moderation

The reporting system provides automatic content moderation:
- **User Reports**: Users can report inappropriate content with specific reasons
- **Feed Filtering**: Reported content is immediately removed from the reporting user's feed
- **Automatic Deletion**: Content is permanently deleted when 2 users report with the same reason
- **Media Cleanup**: All associated media is automatically removed from Cloudinary when content is deleted

This ensures a safe and appropriate content environment while maintaining user privacy and preventing abuse of the reporting system.
