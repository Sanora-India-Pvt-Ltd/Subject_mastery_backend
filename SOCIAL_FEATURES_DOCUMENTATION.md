### Key Features:
- **Posts**: Text and/or media content (images/videos) with reactions and comments
- **Reels**: Video content categorized by type (education/fun) with reactions and comments
- **Reactions**: 6 reaction types (happy, sad, angry, hug, wow, like)
- **Comments**: Text-based comments on posts and reels
- **Reporting**: Report inappropriate content with automatic moderation
- **Blocking**: Block users to prevent seeing their content and prevent them from seeing yours
- **Pagination**: All list endpoints support pagination

## Posts

### 1. Create Post

**Method:** `POST`  
**URL:** `/api/posts/create`  
**Authentication:** Required

**Description:**  
Create a new post with optional file uploads. This endpoint combines media upload and post creation in a single API call. Posts can have a caption, media (images/videos), or both.

**Content-Type:** `multipart/form-data`

**Headers:**
```
Authorization: Bearer your_access_token_here
```

**Request:**
- **Field Name:** `caption` (string, optional): Post caption (max 2200 characters)
- **Field Name:** `media` (file, optional): Can upload multiple files (up to 10 files)
  - **File Types:** Images (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, etc.) and Videos (MP4, MOV, AVI, etc.)
  - **Max File Size:** 20MB per file

**Example using cURL:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/posts/create \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -F "caption=Check out this amazing sunset! 🌅" \
  -F "media=@/path/to/image1.jpg" \
  -F "media=@/path/to/image2.jpg"
```

**Example using JavaScript (FormData):**
```javascript
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('caption', 'Check out this amazing sunset! 🌅');
formData.append('media', fileInput1.files[0]); // First image
formData.append('media', fileInput2.files[0]); // Second image (optional)

const response = await fetch('https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/posts/create', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`
  },
  body: formData
});

const result = await response.json();
```

**Text-Only Post Example:**
```json
{
  "caption": "Just a text post!"
}
```

**Media-Only Post Example (with file upload):**
```javascript
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('media', fileInput.files[0]);

const response = await fetch('https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/posts/create', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`
  },
  body: formData
});
```

**Note:** 
- When uploading files directly, videos are automatically transcoded to H.264 Baseline Profile 3.1 with yuv420p pixel format and faststart enabled for maximum compatibility
- You can upload up to 10 files in a single request
- Files are automatically uploaded to Cloudinary and the post is created in one step

## Reactions System

### Overview

The reactions system allows users to express their feelings about posts and reels using 6 different reaction types:

1. **happy** 😊 - Express happiness or joy
2. **sad** 😢 - Express sadness or empathy
3. **angry** 😠 - Express anger or frustration
4. **hug** 🤗 - Express support or comfort
5. **wow** 😲 - Express surprise or amazement
6. **like** 👍 - Standard like reaction (default)

### Reaction Behavior

- **First Reaction**: When a user reacts for the first time, the reaction is added
- **Same Reaction Again**: If the user clicks the same reaction again, it removes the reaction (unlike)
- **Different Reaction**: If the user clicks a different reaction, it updates to the new reaction
- **One Reaction Per User**: Each user can only have one reaction at a time per post/reel

### Reaction Data Structure

The likes array is structured as a nested array where each sub-array contains user IDs for a specific reaction type:
```json
[
  [],  // Index 0: happy reactions (user IDs)
  [],  // Index 1: sad reactions (user IDs)
  [],  // Index 2: angry reactions (user IDs)
  [],  // Index 3: hug reactions (user IDs)
  [],  // Index 4: wow reactions (user IDs)
  []   // Index 5: like reactions (user IDs)
]
```

**Example:**
```json
{
  "likes": [
    ["user_id_1", "user_id_2"],  // 2 happy reactions
    ["user_id_3"],                // 1 sad reaction
    [],                           // 0 angry reactions
    [],                           // 0 hug reactions
    ["user_id_4"],                // 1 wow reaction
    ["user_id_5", "user_id_6", "user_id_7"]  // 3 like reactions
  ]
}
```

### Reaction Counts

You can get reaction counts by checking the length of each sub-array:
```javascript
const reactionCounts = {
  happy: likes[0] ? likes[0].length : 0,
  sad: likes[1] ? likes[1].length : 0,
  angry: likes[2] ? likes[2].length : 0,
  hug: likes[3] ? likes[3].length : 0,
  wow: likes[4] ? likes[4].length : 0,
  like: likes[5] ? likes[5].length : 0
};

// Total reactions
const totalReactions = reactionCounts.happy + reactionCounts.sad + 
                       reactionCounts.angry + reactionCounts.hug + 
                       reactionCounts.wow + reactionCounts.like;

// Check if a specific user has reacted
const userId = "user_id_1";
const userReaction = likes[0].includes(userId) ? 'happy' :
                     likes[1].includes(userId) ? 'sad' :
                     likes[2].includes(userId) ? 'angry' :
                     likes[3].includes(userId) ? 'hug' :
                     likes[4].includes(userId) ? 'wow' :
                     likes[5].includes(userId) ? 'like' : null;
```

## Comments System

### Overview

The comments system allows users to add text-based comments to posts and reels.

### Comment Data Structure

Each comment contains:
```json
{
  "_id": "comment_id_123",
  "userId": {
    "_id": "user_id_456",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "profileImage": "https://..."
  },
  "text": "This is an amazing post! Great work! 👏",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T11:30:00.000Z"
}
```

### Comment Limits

- **Character Limits**:
  - **Posts**: Maximum 1000 characters per comment
  - **Reels**: Maximum 500 characters per comment
- **Fetch Limit**: Only the **15 most recent comments** are returned in API responses. Comments are sorted by `createdAt` in descending order (newest first).
- **Total Count**: The `commentCount` field always reflects the total number of comments, even if more than 15 exist.

**Note:** When a post or reel has more than 15 comments, only the 15 most recent ones are included in the `comments` array. The `commentCount` field will show the actual total, allowing clients to display "View more comments" functionality if needed.

### Comment Permissions

- **Add Comment**: Any authenticated user can add comments
- **Delete Comment**: Only the comment owner or post/reel owner can delete comments

---

## Blocking System

### Overview

The blocking system allows users to block other users, preventing mutual interaction and content visibility. When a user blocks another user:

1. **Content Visibility**: Blocked users' posts, reels, and stories are automatically excluded from feeds
2. **Profile Access**: Blocked users cannot view each other's content when accessing specific user profiles
3. **Bidirectional**: Blocking works both ways - if User A blocks User B, User B also cannot see User A's content
4. **Automatic Cleanup**: When blocking, users are automatically removed from each other's friends list and any pending friend requests are cancelled
5. **Privacy**: Users cannot see who has blocked them - error messages are generic to protect privacy

### Blocking Behavior by Feature

#### Posts
- **Feed (`/api/posts/all`)**: Posts from blocked users are automatically filtered out
- **User Posts (`/api/posts/user/:id`)**: Returns `403 Forbidden` with generic message if either user has blocked the other (users cannot see who blocked them)

#### Reels
- **Feed (`/api/reels`)**: Reels from blocked users are automatically filtered out
- **User Reels (`/api/reels/user/:id`)**: Returns `403 Forbidden` with generic message if either user has blocked the other (users cannot see who blocked them)

#### Stories
- **Friends Stories (`/api/stories/friends`)**: Stories from blocked users are automatically filtered out
- **User Stories (`/api/stories/user/:id`)**: Returns `403 Forbidden` with generic message if either user has blocked the other (users cannot see who blocked them)

#### Friends System
- Blocked users cannot send friend requests to each other
- Blocked users cannot accept friend requests from each other
- Blocked users are automatically removed from each other's friends list when blocking occurs
- Blocked users are excluded from friend suggestions

#### Chat System
- Blocked users cannot create conversations with each other
- Blocked users cannot send messages to each other
- Existing conversations with blocked users are filtered from conversation lists

#### Search
- Blocked users are excluded from search results
- Users who have blocked you are also excluded from your search results (users cannot see who blocked them)

1. **Bidirectional Blocking**: Blocking is bidirectional - if User A blocks User B, both users cannot see each other's content
2. **Feed Filtering**: Blocked content is automatically filtered from feeds when the user is authenticated
3. **Profile Access**: Attempting to access a blocked user's profile content will return a `403 Forbidden` error with a generic message (users cannot see who blocked them)
4. **Automatic Cleanup**: When blocking, the system automatically:
   - Removes users from each other's friends list
   - Cancels any pending friend requests between them
5. **Unblocking**: Users can unblock each other at any time, which restores normal interaction capabilities

## Reporting System

### Overview

The reporting system allows users to report inappropriate posts and reels. The system automatically moderates content based on user reports, removing reported content from user feeds and permanently deleting content when multiple users report with the same reason.

### Report Reasons

Users can report content for the following reasons:

1. **problem_involving_someone_under_18** - Content involving someone under 18
2. **bullying_harassment_or_abuse** - Bullying, harassment or abuse
3. **suicide_or_self_harm** - Suicide or self-harm content
4. **violent_hateful_or_disturbing_content** - Violent, hateful or disturbing content
5. **adult_content** - Adult content
6. **scam_fraud_or_false_information** - Scam, fraud or false information
7. **intellectual_property** - Intellectual property violation
8. **political** - Political content
9. **i_dont_want_to_see_this** - User preference (don't want to see this content)

### Reporting Behavior

#### Immediate Effects
- **Feed Removal**: When a user reports a post or reel, it is immediately removed from their feed
- **One Report Per User**: Each user can only report the same content once
- **Self-Reporting Prevention**: Users cannot report their own content

#### Automatic Moderation
- **Threshold**: When 2 users report the same content with the **same reason**, the content is automatically deleted
- **Permanent Deletion**: Deleted content is permanently removed from the database
- **Media Cleanup**: All associated media (images, videos, thumbnails) is automatically deleted from Cloudinary

### Feed Filtering

Reported content is automatically filtered from user feeds:

- **Get All Posts** (`/api/posts/all`): Excludes posts reported by the authenticated user
- **Get Reels** (`/api/reels`): Excludes reels reported by the authenticated user
- **Get User Posts** (`/api/posts/user/:id`): Excludes posts reported by the viewing user
- **Get User Reels** (`/api/reels/user/:id`): Excludes reels reported by the viewing user

**Note:** Feed filtering only applies when the user is authenticated. Unauthenticated users see all content.

**Combined Filtering:**
- Feeds apply both reporting and blocking filters simultaneously
- Content is excluded if it's either reported by the user OR from a blocked user
- This ensures users only see content they want to see

### Report Data Structure

Each report contains:
```json
{
  "_id": "report_id_123",
  "userId": "user_id_456",
  "contentId": "post_id_789",
  "contentType": "post",
  "reason": "bullying_harassment_or_abuse",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T12:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-01-15T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Best Practices

1. **Report Accuracy**: Users should select the most appropriate reason for reporting
2. **Multiple Reports**: The system requires 2 users with the same reason to trigger deletion
3. **Feed Privacy**: Reported content is only hidden from the reporting user's feed, not from all users
4. **Content Moderation**: The automatic deletion threshold helps prevent abuse while allowing legitimate moderation

### Example Workflow

```javascript
// Report a post
async function reportPost(postId, reason) {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/posts/${postId}/report`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ reason })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  
  if (data.data.postDeleted) {
    console.log('Post was deleted due to multiple reports');
  } else {
    console.log('Post reported successfully');
  }
  
  return data;
}

// Report a reel
async function reportReel(reelId, reason) {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/reels/${reelId}/report`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ reason })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}
```

## Data Models

### Post Model

```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  userId: ObjectId (ref: User),
  caption: String (max 2200),
  media: [{
    url: String,
    publicId: String,
    type: String (enum: ['image', 'video']),
    format: String
  }],
  likes: [[ObjectId]], // Nested array: [happy[], sad[], angry[], hug[], wow[], like[]]
  comments: [{
    userId: ObjectId (ref: User),
    text: String (max 1000),
    createdAt: Date
  }],
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Reel Model

```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  userId: ObjectId (ref: User),
  caption: String (max 2200),
  media: {
    url: String,
    publicId: String,
    thumbnailUrl: String,
    type: String (enum: ['video']),
    format: String,
    duration: Number,
    dimensions: {
      width: Number,
      height: Number
    },
    size: Number
  },
  contentType: String (enum: ['education', 'fun']),
  visibility: String (enum: ['public', 'followers', 'private']),
  views: Number,
  likes: [[ObjectId]], // Nested array: [happy[], sad[], angry[], hug[], wow[], like[]]
  comments: [{
    userId: ObjectId (ref: User),
    text: String (max 500),
    createdAt: Date
  }],
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Report Model

```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  userId: ObjectId (ref: User),
  contentId: ObjectId,
  contentType: String (enum: ['post', 'reel']),
  reason: String (enum: [
    'problem_involving_someone_under_18',
    'bullying_harassment_or_abuse',
    'suicide_or_self_harm',
    'violent_hateful_or_disturbing_content',
    'adult_content',
    'scam_fraud_or_false_information',
    'intellectual_property',
    'political',
    'i_dont_want_to_see_this'
  ]),
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

**Indexes:**
- Unique compound index on `(userId, contentId, contentType)` - prevents duplicate reports
- Compound index on `(contentId, contentType, reason)` - for efficient threshold checking

## Error Handling

### Standard Error Response Format

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error message describing what went wrong",
  "error": "Detailed error message (in development)"
}
```

### Common HTTP Status Codes

- `200` - Success
- `201` - Created successfully
- `400` - Bad Request (validation errors, invalid parameters)
- `401` - Unauthorized (authentication required)
- `403` - Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
- `404` - Not Found (resource doesn't exist)
- `500` - Internal Server Error

### JavaScript/TypeScript Example

```javascript
// React to a post
async function reactToPost(postId, reaction = 'like') {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/posts/${postId}/like`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ reaction })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}

// Add comment to a post
async function addComment(postId, text) {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/posts/${postId}/comment`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ text })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}

// Get posts with pagination
async function getPosts(page = 1, limit = 10) {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/posts/all?page=${page}&limit=${limit}`
  );
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}

// Report a post
async function reportPost(postId, reason) {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/posts/${postId}/report`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ reason })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}

// Report a reel
async function reportReel(reelId, reason) {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/reels/${reelId}/report`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ reason })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Media Upload**: Upload files directly when creating posts using the `/api/posts/create` endpoint with `multipart/form-data` - this combines upload and post creation in one step
2. **Pagination**: Use pagination for large datasets to improve performance
3. **Error Handling**: Always check the `success` field in responses
4. **Reaction Updates**: Handle the three possible actions: "liked", "unliked", "reaction_updated"
5. **Comment Length**: Respect character limits (1000 for posts, 500 for reels)
6. **Comment Display**: Only 15 most recent comments are returned. Use `commentCount` to determine if more comments exist and implement "View more comments" functionality if needed
7. **Reporting**: Select the most appropriate reason when reporting content
8. **Blocking**: Use blocking to prevent seeing unwanted content and to prevent others from seeing your content
9. **Authentication**: Store and refresh access tokens securely
10. **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of API rate limits when making multiple requests
11. **Feed Filtering**: Remember that both reported and blocked content is automatically filtered from authenticated user feeds
12. **Multiple Files**: You can upload up to 10 files in a single post creation request for carousel posts

## Important Notes

### Likes/Reactions Structure

The likes array uses a nested array structure for efficient storage:
- `likes[0]` = happy reactions (array of user IDs)
- `likes[1]` = sad reactions (array of user IDs)
- `likes[2]` = angry reactions (array of user IDs)
- `likes[3]` = hug reactions (array of user IDs)
- `likes[4]` = wow reactions (array of user IDs)
- `likes[5]` = like reactions (array of user IDs)

This structure allows for efficient querying and counting of reactions without needing to store reaction type with each user ID.

### Video Transcoding

All videos uploaded to posts and reels are automatically transcoded to ensure compatibility:
- **Codec:** H.264 Baseline Profile 3.1
- **Pixel Format:** yuv420p
- **Faststart:** Enabled (for progressive playback)

This ensures videos play smoothly across all devices and browsers.

### Media Upload Flow

**For Posts:**
1. **Upload files directly** when creating a post using `/api/posts/create` with `multipart/form-data`
2. **Files are automatically** uploaded to Cloudinary, transcoded (if videos), and the post is created in one API call
3. **Media is stored** in Cloudinary and referenced in the database automatically
4. **Supports multiple files** - upload up to 10 files in a single request for carousel posts

**For Reels:**
1. **Upload media first** using `/api/reels/upload-media`
2. **Use the response data** to create the reel with the returned `url`, `publicId`, and other metadata
3. **Media is stored** in Cloudinary and referenced in the database

**Note:** The single-step approach for posts simplifies the workflow and reduces the number of API calls needed.

### Content Moderation

The reporting system provides automatic content moderation:
- **User Reports**: Users can report inappropriate content with specific reasons
- **Feed Filtering**: Reported content is immediately removed from the reporting user's feed
- **Automatic Deletion**: Content is permanently deleted when 2 users report with the same reason
- **Media Cleanup**: All associated media is automatically removed from Cloudinary when content is deleted

This ensures a safe and appropriate content environment while maintaining user privacy and preventing abuse of the reporting system.

### Blocking System

The blocking system provides additional content control:

- **User Control**: Users can block other users to prevent mutual interaction
- **Content Filtering**: Blocked users' content is automatically excluded from feeds
- **Bidirectional**: Blocking works both ways for complete privacy
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Blocking automatically removes users from friends lists and cancels pending requests

Combined with the reporting system, users have comprehensive tools to control their social media experience and maintain a safe environment.
