## Overview

The Social Features API provides endpoints for creating and managing posts, reels, comments, and reactions. All social interactions support rich media content, reactions (happy, sad, angry, hug, wow, like), and comments.

### Key Features:
- **Posts**: Text and/or media content (images/videos) with reactions and comments
- **Reels**: Video content categorized by type (education/fun) with reactions and comments
- **Reactions**: 6 reaction types (happy, sad, angry, hug, wow, like)
- **Comments**: Highly scalable comment system with separate collection, supporting unlimited comments and replies
- **Reporting**: Report inappropriate content with automatic moderation
- **Blocking**: Block users to prevent seeing their content and prevent them from seeing yours
- **Pagination**: All list endpoints support pagination

## Posts

### 1. Create Post

**Method:** `POST`  
**URL:** `/api/posts/create`  
**Authentication:** Required

**Description:**  
Create a new post with optional file uploads. This endpoint combines media upload and post creation in a single API call. Posts can have a caption, media (images/videos), or both.

**Content-Type:** `multipart/form-data`

**Headers:**
```
Authorization: Bearer your_access_token_here
```

**Request:**
- **Field Name:** `caption` (string, optional): Post caption (max 2200 characters)
- **Field Name:** `media` (file, optional): Can upload multiple files (up to 10 files)
  - **File Types:** Images (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, etc.) and Videos (MP4, MOV, AVI, etc.)
  - **Max File Size:** 20MB per file

**Example using cURL:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/posts/create \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -F "caption=Check out this amazing sunset! 🌅" \
  -F "media=@/path/to/image1.jpg" \
  -F "media=@/path/to/image2.jpg"
```

**Example using JavaScript (FormData):**
```javascript
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('caption', 'Check out this amazing sunset! 🌅');
formData.append('media', fileInput1.files[0]); // First image
formData.append('media', fileInput2.files[0]); // Second image (optional)

const response = await fetch('https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/posts/create', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`
  },
  body: formData
});

const result = await response.json();
```

**Text-Only Post Example:**
```json
{
  "caption": "Just a text post!"
}
```

**Media-Only Post Example (with file upload):**
```javascript
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('media', fileInput.files[0]);

const response = await fetch('https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/posts/create', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`
  },
  body: formData
});
```

**Note:** 
- When uploading files directly, videos are automatically transcoded to H.264 Baseline Profile 3.1 with yuv420p pixel format and faststart enabled for maximum compatibility
- You can upload up to 10 files in a single request
- Files are automatically uploaded to Cloudinary and the post is created in one step

## Reactions System

### Overview

The reactions system allows users to express their feelings about posts and reels using 6 different reaction types. The system now uses a separate `Like` collection for better performance and scalability.

### Available Reactions

1. **happy** 😊 - Express happiness or joy
2. **sad** 😢 - Express sadness or empathy
3. **angry** 😠 - Express anger or frustration
4. **hug** 🤗 - Express support or comfort
5. **wow** 😲 - Express surprise or amazement
6. **like** 👍 - Standard like reaction (default)

### API Endpoints

#### Like/Unlike Post
**URL:** `POST /api/likes/post/:id`  
**Authentication:** Required

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "reaction": "like"  // Optional, defaults to 'like'
}
```

**Success Response (200):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Post liked successfully",
  "data": {
    "action": "liked",  // or "unliked" or "reaction_updated"
    "reaction": "happy",  // null if unliked
    "likeCount": 42,
    "isLiked": true
  }
}
```

#### Like/Unlike Reel
**URL:** `POST /api/likes/reel/:id`  
**Authentication:** Required

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "reaction": "happy"  // Optional, defaults to 'like'
}
```

**Success Response (200):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Reel liked successfully",
  "data": {
    "action": "liked",  // or "unliked" or "reaction_updated"
    "reaction": "happy",  // null if unliked
    "likeCount": 24,
    "isLiked": true
  }
}
```

#### Get Reactions
**URL:** `GET /api/likes/:content(post|reel)/:contentId`  
**Authentication:** Optional

**URL Parameters:**
- `content`: Either "post" or "reel"
- `contentId`: ID of the post or reel

**Success Response (200):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "happy": {
      "count": 5,
      "users": [
        {
          "id": "user_id_1",
          "name": "John Doe",
          "profileImage": "https://..."
        }
      ]
    },
    "like": {
      "count": 10,
      "users": [...]
    }
  }
}
```

### Reaction Behavior

- **First Reaction**: When a user reacts for the first time, the reaction is added
- **Same Reaction Again**: If the user clicks the same reaction again, it removes the reaction (unlike)
- **Different Reaction**: If the user clicks a different reaction, it updates to the new reaction
- **One Reaction Per User**: Each user can only have one reaction at a time per post/reel
- **Performance Optimized**: The system maintains a `likeCount` on posts/reels for quick access

### Data Structure

#### Post/Reel Model
```json
{
  "_id": "post_id_123",
  "likeCount": 15,
  "comments": [...],
  "createdAt": "2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

#### Like Model
```json
{
  "_id": "like_id_123",
  "user": "user_id_1",
  "content": "post",  // or "reel"
  "contentId": "post_id_123",
  "reaction": "happy",
  "createdAt": "2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Migration

A migration script is available to transfer existing likes to the new system:

```bash
node scripts/migrateLikes.js
```

### Best Practices

1. **Client-Side Caching**: Cache the user's reaction state locally to provide immediate feedback
2. **Optimistic Updates**: Update the UI optimistically before the API responds
3. **Error Handling**: Handle cases where the API call fails and revert UI changes if needed
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement client-side rate limiting to prevent spam
5. **Offline Support**: Queue reactions when offline and sync when back online
                     likes[2].includes(userId) ? 'angry' :
                     likes[3].includes(userId) ? 'hug' :
                     likes[4].includes(userId) ? 'wow' :
                     likes[5].includes(userId) ? 'like' : null;
```

## Comments System

### Overview

The comments system uses a **separate, highly scalable Comment collection** with a unique architecture: **each post or reel has exactly ONE document** that contains all comments and replies in array-in-array format. This design provides excellent scalability while maintaining efficient querying.

### Key Features

- ✅ **One Document Per Post/Reel**: Each post/reel has a single Comment document identified by `contentId` + `contentType`
- ✅ **Array-in-Array Format**: All comments stored in a `comments` array, with replies nested in each comment's `replies` array
- ✅ **Efficient Queries**: Single document lookup per post/reel for fast retrieval
- ✅ **Pagination Support**: In-memory pagination for comments and replies
- ✅ **Unified API**: Single API for both posts and reels
- ✅ **Unlimited Comments**: No document size limit issues (MongoDB handles large arrays efficiently)

### How It Works

**Each post or reel has ONE Comment document:**

```json
{
  "_id": "comment_doc_id_123",
  "contentId": "post_id_456",  // Unique - identifies which post/reel
  "contentType": "post",        // "post" or "reel"
  "comments": [
    {
      "_id": "comment_id_789",
      "userId": "user_id_111",
      "text": "Great post!",
      "createdAt": "2024-01-15T11:30:00.000Z",
      "replies": [
        {
          "_id": "reply_id_222",
          "userId": "user_id_333",
          "text": "I agree!",
          "createdAt": "2024-01-15T12:00:00.000Z"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "_id": "comment_id_790",
      "userId": "user_id_444",
      "text": "Nice work!",
      "createdAt": "2024-01-15T11:35:00.000Z",
      "replies": []
    }
  ],
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T11:30:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-01-15T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**Key Points:**
- `contentId` is **unique** - ensures only one document per post/reel
- All comments for that post/reel are in the `comments` array
- Each comment can have replies in its `replies` array (array-in-array format)
- The system automatically creates the document when the first comment is added

### Comment Data Structure (API Response)

When fetching comments, the API returns formatted comment objects:
```json
{
  "id": "comment_id_123",
  "userId": "user_id_456",
  "user": {
    "id": "user_id_456",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "profileImage": "https://..."
  },
  "text": "This is an amazing post! Great work! 👏",
  "replies": [
    {
      "id": "reply_id_789",
      "userId": "user_id_789",
      "user": {
        "id": "user_id_789",
        "firstName": "Jane",
        "lastName": "Smith",
        "name": "Jane Smith",
        "profileImage": "https://..."
      },
      "text": "I totally agree!",
      "createdAt": "2024-01-15T12:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "replyCount": 1,
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T11:30:00.000Z"
}
```

### How the System Identifies Posts/Reels

The system uses a **unique combination** of two fields to identify which post or reel a comment belongs to:

1. **`contentId`**: The MongoDB ObjectId of the post or reel
2. **`contentType`**: Either `"post"` or `"reel"`

**Key Points:**
- Each post/reel has **exactly ONE** Comment document
- The `contentId` field is **unique** in the database (enforced by unique index)
- When you add a comment, the system:
  1. Checks if a Comment document exists for that `contentId` + `contentType`
  2. If it exists, adds the comment to the `comments` array
  3. If it doesn't exist, creates a new Comment document with an empty `comments` array, then adds the comment

**Example:**
```javascript
// Post with ID "post_123" has ONE Comment document:
{
  _id: "comment_doc_abc",
  contentId: "post_123",  // ← Links to the post
  contentType: "post",     // ← Identifies it's a post
  comments: [...]
}

// Reel with ID "reel_456" has ONE Comment document:
{
  _id: "comment_doc_xyz",
  contentId: "reel_456",  // ← Links to the reel
  contentType: "reel",    // ← Identifies it's a reel
  comments: [...]
}
```

**Why This Design?**
- ✅ **Efficient**: Single document lookup per post/reel
- ✅ **Scalable**: MongoDB handles large arrays efficiently
- ✅ **Simple**: All comments for a post/reel in one place
- ✅ **Fast Queries**: Direct access to all comments without joins

### Comment Limits

- **Character Limits**:
  - **Posts**: Maximum 1000 characters per comment/reply
  - **Reels**: Maximum 500 characters per comment/reply
- **Pagination**: Comments support pagination with configurable page size (default: 15)
- **Replies**: Each comment can have unlimited replies (stored in array-in-array format)

### Comment Permissions

- **Add Comment**: Any authenticated user can add comments
- **Add Reply**: Any authenticated user can reply to comments
- **Delete Comment**: Only the comment owner or post/reel owner can delete comments
- **Delete Reply**: Only the reply owner, comment owner, or post/reel owner can delete replies

### Architecture Summary

**One Document Per Post/Reel:**
- Each post or reel has **exactly ONE** Comment document in the database
- The document is identified by the unique combination of `contentId` + `contentType`
- All comments for that post/reel are stored in the `comments` array within that single document
- Each comment can have replies stored in its `replies` array (array-in-array format)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Efficient Queries**: Single document lookup per post/reel (no joins needed)
- ✅ **Fast Retrieval**: All comments loaded in one database query
- ✅ **Scalable**: MongoDB efficiently handles large arrays
- ✅ **Simple Structure**: Easy to understand and maintain
- ✅ **Atomic Operations**: All comments for a post/reel updated atomically

**Example Flow:**
```javascript
// 1. User comments on post "post_123"
POST /api/comments
{
  contentId: "post_123",
  contentType: "post",
  text: "Great post!"
}

// 2. System creates/finds the Comment document for post_123:
{
  _id: "comment_doc_abc",
  contentId: "post_123",  // Unique identifier
  contentType: "post",
  comments: [
    {
      _id: "comment_1",
      userId: "user_1",
      text: "Great post!",
      replies: []
    }
  ]
}

// 3. User replies to comment_1:
POST /api/comments/comment_1/reply
{
  contentId: "post_123",  // Required to find the document
  contentType: "post",
  text: "I agree!"
}

// 4. System updates the same document:
{
  _id: "comment_doc_abc",
  contentId: "post_123",
  contentType: "post",
  comments: [
    {
      _id: "comment_1",
      userId: "user_1",
      text: "Great post!",
      replies: [
        {
          _id: "reply_1",
          userId: "user_2",
          text: "I agree!"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Legacy Comment Endpoints (Deprecated)

The following endpoints are **deprecated** but still functional for backward compatibility. Please use the new `/api/comments` endpoints instead:

- `POST /api/posts/:id/comment` - Use `POST /api/comments` instead
- `DELETE /api/posts/:id/comment/:commentId` - Use `DELETE /api/comments/:commentId` instead
- `POST /api/reels/:id/comment` - Use `POST /api/comments` instead
- `DELETE /api/reels/:id/comment/:commentId` - Use `DELETE /api/comments/:commentId` instead

**Note:** These legacy endpoints will be removed in a future version. Please migrate to the new Comment API.

## Blocking System

### Overview

The blocking system allows users to block other users, preventing mutual interaction and content visibility. When a user blocks another user:

1. **Content Visibility**: Blocked users' posts, reels, and stories are automatically excluded from feeds
2. **Profile Access**: Blocked users cannot view each other's content when accessing specific user profiles
3. **Bidirectional**: Blocking works both ways - if User A blocks User B, User B also cannot see User A's content
4. **Automatic Cleanup**: When blocking, users are automatically removed from each other's friends list and any pending friend requests are cancelled
5. **Privacy**: Users cannot see who has blocked them - error messages are generic to protect privacy

### Blocking Behavior by Feature

#### Posts
- **Feed (`/api/posts/all`)**: Posts from blocked users are automatically filtered out
- **User Posts (`/api/posts/user/:id`)**: Returns `403 Forbidden` with generic message if either user has blocked the other (users cannot see who blocked them)

#### Reels
- **Feed (`/api/reels`)**: Reels from blocked users are automatically filtered out
- **User Reels (`/api/reels/user/:id`)**: Returns `403 Forbidden` with generic message if either user has blocked the other (users cannot see who blocked them)

#### Stories
- **Friends Stories (`/api/stories/all`)**: Stories from blocked users are automatically filtered out
- **User Stories (`/api/stories/user/:id`)**: Returns `403 Forbidden` with generic message if either user has blocked the other (users cannot see who blocked them)

#### Friends System
- Blocked users cannot send friend requests to each other
- Blocked users cannot accept friend requests from each other
- Blocked users are automatically removed from each other's friends list when blocking occurs
- Blocked users are excluded from friend suggestions

#### Chat System
- Blocked users cannot create conversations with each other
- Blocked users cannot send messages to each other
- Existing conversations with blocked users are filtered from conversation lists

#### Search
- Blocked users are excluded from search results
- Users who have blocked you are also excluded from your search results (users cannot see who blocked them)

### Blocking Endpoints

#### 1. Block a User

**Method:** `POST`  
**URL:** `/api/user/block/:blockedUserId`  
**Authentication:** Required

**Description:**  
Block a user. When you block a user, they are automatically removed from your friends list (if they were a friend), any pending friend requests between you are cancelled, and you will no longer see their content in feeds. The blocked user will also not be able to see your content.

**Headers:**
```
Authorization: Bearer your_access_token_here
```

**URL Parameters:**
- `blockedUserId` (string, required): ID of the user to block

**Example Request:**
```bash
POST /api/user/block/user_id_123
```

**Example using cURL:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/user/block/user_id_123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

**Example using JavaScript:**
```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/user/block/user_id_123', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`
  }
});

const data = await response.json();
```

**Success Response (200):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "User blocked successfully",
  "data": {
    "blockedUser": {
      "_id": "user_id_123",
      "firstName": "Jane",
      "lastName": "Smith",
      "name": "Jane Smith",
      "profileImage": "https://...",

        "name": "Jane Smith",
        "profileImage": "https://...",
        "email": "jane@example.com"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Error Responses:**
- `400`: Invalid user ID, you cannot block yourself, user is already blocked
- `401`: Not authenticated
- `404`: User not found
- `500`: Failed to block user

**Note:** 
- Blocking automatically removes the user from your friends list (if they were a friend)
- Any pending friend requests between you and the blocked user are automatically cancelled
- Blocking is bidirectional - the blocked user cannot see your content either

---

#### 2. Unblock a User

**Method:** `DELETE`  
**URL:** `/api/user/block/:blockedUserId`  
**Authentication:** Required

**Description:**  
Unblock a previously blocked user. After unblocking, you will be able to see their content again, and they will be able to see yours. However, you will need to send a new friend request if you want to be friends again.

**Headers:**
```
Authorization: Bearer your_access_token_here
```

**URL Parameters:**
- `blockedUserId` (string, required): ID of the user to unblock

**Example Request:**
```bash
DELETE /api/user/block/user_id_123
```

**Example using cURL:**
```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/user/block/user_id_123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

**Example using JavaScript:**
```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/user/block/user_id_123', {
  method: 'DELETE',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`
  }
});

      "lastName": "Smith",
      "name": "Jane Smith",
      "profileImage": "https://...",
      "email": "jane@example.com"
    },
    "blockedUsers": []
  }
}
```

**Error Responses:**
- `400`: Invalid user ID, user is not blocked
- `401`: Not authenticated
- `404`: User not found
- `500`: Failed to unblock user

**Note:** 
- Unblocking does not automatically restore the friendship - you'll need to send a new friend request

- `404`: User not found
- `500`: Failed to retrieve blocked users

---

### Important Notes

1. **Bidirectional Blocking**: Blocking is bidirectional - if User A blocks User B, both users cannot see each other's content
2. **Feed Filtering**: Blocked content is automatically filtered from feeds when the user is authenticated
3. **Profile Access**: Attempting to access a blocked user's profile content will return a `403 Forbidden` error with a generic message (users cannot see who blocked them)
4. **Automatic Cleanup**: When blocking, the system automatically:
   - Removes users from each other's friends list
   - Cancels any pending friend requests between them
5. **Unblocking**: Users can unblock each other at any time, which restores normal interaction capabilities

---

## Reporting System

### Overview

The reporting system allows users to report inappropriate posts and reels. The system automatically moderates content based on user reports, removing reported content from user feeds and permanently deleting content when multiple users report with the same reason.

### Report Reasons

Users can report content for the following reasons:

1. **problem_involving_someone_under_18**
2. **bullying_harassment_or_abuse**
3. **suicide_or_self_harm**
4. **violent_hateful_or_disturbing_content**
5. **adult_content**
6. **scam_fraud_or_false_information**
7. **intellectual_property**
8. **political**
9. **i_dont_want_to_see_this**

### Reporting Behavior

#### Immediate Effects
- **Feed Removal**: When a user reports a post or reel, it is immediately removed from their feed
- **One Report Per User**: Each user can only report the same content once
- **Self-Reporting Prevention**: Users cannot report their own content

#### Automatic Moderation
- **Threshold**: When 2 users report the same content with the **same reason**, the content is automatically deleted
- **Permanent Deletion**: Deleted content is permanently removed from the database
- **Media Cleanup**: All associated media (images, videos, thumbnails) is automatically deleted from Cloudinary

### Feed Filtering

Reported content is automatically filtered from user feeds:

- **Get All Posts** (`/api/posts/all`): Excludes posts reported by the authenticated user
- **Get Reels** (`/api/reels`): Excludes reels reported by the authenticated user
- **Get User Posts** (`/api/posts/user/:id`): Excludes posts reported by the viewing user
- **Get User Reels** (`/api/reels/user/:id`): Excludes reels reported by the viewing user

**Note:** Feed filtering only applies when the user is authenticated. Unauthenticated users see all content.

**Combined Filtering:**
- Feeds apply both reporting and blocking filters simultaneously
- Content is excluded if it's either reported by the user OR from a blocked user
- This ensures users only see content they want to see

### Report Data Structure

Each report contains:
```json
{
  "_id": "report_id_123",
  "userId": "user_id_456",
  "contentId": "post_id_789",
  "contentType": "post",
  "reason": "bullying_harassment_or_abuse",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T12:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-01-15T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## User Reports

### Report a User

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/reports/users/:userId/report`  
**Authentication:** Required  
**Rate Limit:** 5 reports per minute per user

Report a user for violating community guidelines. Each user can only report another user once.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "reason": "bullying_harassment_abuse",
  "description": "User is sending abusive messages"
}
```

**Available Report Reasons:**
- `under_18` - Problem involving someone under 18
- `bullying_harassment_abuse` - Bullying, harassment or abuse
- `suicide_self_harm` - Suicide or self-harm
- `violent_hateful_disturbing` - Violent, hateful or disturbing content
- `restricted_items` - Selling or promoting restricted items
- `adult_content` - Adult content
- `scam_fraud_false_info` - Scam, fraud or false information
- `fake_profile` - Fake profile
- `intellectual_property` - Intellectual property violation
- `other` - Something else

**Success Response (201):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Report submitted successfully",
  "reportId": "report_id_123"
}
```

**Error Responses:**
- `400 Bad Request`: Missing required fields or invalid reason
- `401 Unauthorized`: Not authenticated
- `403 Forbidden`: Cannot report yourself
- `404 Not Found`: User not found
- `409 Conflict`: You have already reported this user
- `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Server error

**Example Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/reports/users/123456/report \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reason": "bullying_harassment_abuse", "description": "User is sending abusive messages"}'
```

### Best Practices

1. **Report Accuracy**: Users should select the most appropriate reason for reporting
2. **No Self-Reports**: Users cannot report themselves
3. **One Report Per User**: Each user can only report another user once
4. **Provide Details**: Include a description to help with moderation
5. **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of the rate limit (5 reports per minute)

### Example Workflow

```javascript
// Report a post
async function reportPost(postId, reason) {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/posts/${postId}/report`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ reason })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  
  if (data.data.postDeleted) {
    console.log('Post was deleted due to multiple reports');
  } else {
    console.log('Post reported successfully');
  }
  
  return data;
}

// Report a reel
async function reportReel(reelId, reason) {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/reels/${reelId}/report`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ reason })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}
```

## Data Models

### Post Model

```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  userId: ObjectId (ref: User),
  caption: String (max 2200),
  media: [{
    url: String,
    publicId: String,
    type: String (enum: ['image', 'video']),
    format: String
  }],
  likes: [[ObjectId]], // Nested array: [happy[], sad[], angry[], hug[], wow[], like[]]
  comments: [{
    userId: ObjectId (ref: User),
    text: String (max 1000),
    createdAt: Date
  }],
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Reel Model

```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  userId: ObjectId (ref: User),
  caption: String (max 2200),
  media: {
    url: String,
    publicId: String,
    thumbnailUrl: String,
    type: String (enum: ['video']),
    format: String,
    duration: Number,
    dimensions: {
      width: Number,
      height: Number
    },
    size: Number
  },
  contentType: String (enum: ['education', 'fun']),
  visibility: String (enum: ['public', 'followers', 'private']),
  views: Number,
  likes: [[ObjectId]], // Nested array: [happy[], sad[], angry[], hug[], wow[], like[]]
  comments: [{
    userId: ObjectId (ref: User),
    text: String (max 500),
    createdAt: Date
  }],
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Report Model

```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  userId: ObjectId (ref: User),
  contentId: ObjectId,
  contentType: String (enum: ['post', 'reel']),
  reason: String (enum: [
    'problem_involving_someone_under_18',
    'bullying_harassment_or_abuse',
    'suicide_or_self_harm',
    'violent_hateful_or_disturbing_content',
    'adult_content',
    'scam_fraud_or_false_information',
    'intellectual_property',
    'political',
    'i_dont_want_to_see_this'
  ]),
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

**Indexes:**
- Unique compound index on `(userId, contentId, contentType)` - prevents duplicate reports
- Compound index on `(contentId, contentType, reason)` - for efficient threshold checking

---

## Error Handling

### Standard Error Response Format

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error message describing what went wrong",
  "error": "Detailed error message (in development)"
}
```

### Common HTTP Status Codes

- `200` - Success
- `201` - Created successfully
- `400` - Bad Request (validation errors, invalid parameters)
- `401` - Unauthorized (authentication required)
- `403` - Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
- `404` - Not Found (resource doesn't exist)
- `500` - Internal Server Error

---

    "visibility": "public"
  }'
```

**Note:** The two-step approach is maintained for backward compatibility. New implementations should use the combined endpoint.

### Complete Workflow: Report Content

#### Report a Post
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/posts/POST_ID/report \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reason": "bullying_harassment_or_abuse"}'
```

#### Report a Reel
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/reels/REEL_ID/report \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reason": "adult_content"}'
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript Example

```javascript
// React to a post
async function reactToPost(postId, reaction = 'like') {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/posts/${postId}/like`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ reaction })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}

// Add comment to a post
async function addComment(postId, text) {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/posts/${postId}/comment`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ text })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}

// Get posts with pagination
async function getPosts(page = 1, limit = 10) {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/posts/all?page=${page}&limit=${limit}`
  );
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}

// Report a post
async function reportPost(postId, reason) {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/posts/${postId}/report`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ reason })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}

// Report a reel
async function reportReel(reelId, reason) {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.ulearnandearn.com/api/reels/${reelId}/report`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ reason })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Media Upload**: Upload files directly when creating posts using the `/api/posts/create` endpoint with `multipart/form-data` - this combines upload and post creation in one step
2. **Pagination**: Use pagination for large datasets to improve performance
3. **Error Handling**: Always check the `success` field in responses
4. **Reaction Updates**: Handle the three possible actions: "liked", "unliked", "reaction_updated"
5. **Comment Length**: Respect character limits (1000 for posts, 500 for reels)
6. **Comment Display**: Only 15 most recent comments are returned. Use `commentCount` to determine if more comments exist and implement "View more comments" functionality if needed
7. **Reporting**: Select the most appropriate reason when reporting content
8. **Blocking**: Use blocking to prevent seeing unwanted content and to prevent others from seeing your content
9. **Authentication**: Store and refresh access tokens securely
10. **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of API rate limits when making multiple requests
11. **Feed Filtering**: Remember that both reported and blocked content is automatically filtered from authenticated user feeds
12. **Multiple Files**: You can upload up to 10 files in a single post creation request for carousel posts

## Important Notes

### Likes/Reactions Structure

The likes array uses a nested array structure for efficient storage:
- `likes[0]` = happy reactions (array of user IDs)
- `likes[1]` = sad reactions (array of user IDs)
- `likes[2]` = angry reactions (array of user IDs)
- `likes[3]` = hug reactions (array of user IDs)
- `likes[4]` = wow reactions (array of user IDs)
- `likes[5]` = like reactions (array of user IDs)

This structure allows for efficient querying and counting of reactions without needing to store reaction type with each user ID.

### Video Transcoding

All videos uploaded to posts and reels are automatically transcoded to ensure compatibility:
- **Codec:** H.264 Baseline Profile 3.1
- **Pixel Format:** yuv420p
- **Faststart:** Enabled (for progressive playback)

This ensures videos play smoothly across all devices and browsers.

### Media Upload Flow

**For Posts:**
1. **Upload files directly** when creating a post using `/api/posts/create` with `multipart/form-data`
2. **Files are automatically** uploaded to Cloudinary, transcoded (if videos), and the post is created in one API call
3. **Media is stored** in Cloudinary and referenced in the database automatically
4. **Supports multiple files** - upload up to 10 files in a single request for carousel posts

**For Reels:**
1. **Recommended:** Upload video and create reel in one step using `/api/reels/create` with `multipart/form-data`
   - **Files are automatically** uploaded to Cloudinary, transcoded (if needed), and the reel is created in one API call
   - **Media is stored** in Cloudinary and referenced in the database automatically
2. **Legacy:** Two-step process (for backward compatibility)
   - **Upload media first** using `/api/reels/upload-media`
   - **Use the response data** to create the reel with `/api/reels/create-with-media` using the returned `url`, `publicId`, and other metadata

**Note:** The single-step approach for both posts and reels simplifies the workflow and reduces the number of API calls needed. Videos are automatically transcoded to H.264 Baseline Profile 3.1 with yuv420p pixel format and faststart enabled for maximum Android and cross-platform compatibility.

### Content Moderation

The reporting system provides automatic content moderation:
- **User Reports**: Users can report inappropriate content with specific reasons
- **Feed Filtering**: Reported content is immediately removed from the reporting user's feed
- **Automatic Deletion**: Content is permanently deleted when 2 users report with the same reason
- **Media Cleanup**: All associated media is automatically removed from Cloudinary when content is deleted

This ensures a safe and appropriate content environment while maintaining user privacy and preventing abuse of the reporting system.

### Blocking System

The blocking system provides additional content control:

- **User Control**: Users can block other users to prevent mutual interaction
- **Content Filtering**: Blocked users' content is automatically excluded from feeds
- **Bidirectional**: Blocking works both ways for complete privacy
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Blocking automatically removes users from friends lists and cancels pending requests

Combined with the reporting system, users have comprehensive tools to control their social media experience and maintain a safe environment.
